  "<h1>HTML</h1>\nHTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Simply put, its the language that gives webpages <em> structure </em>. HTML is the language that the web is built on. Every webpage is actually an html file. \n\n<h2>Tags</h2>\nHTML is written with tags that a browser can read and use to structure the text. When a page is rendered in the browser, the tags remain hidden.\n\nMost tags require a closing tag. For example  is the opening tag and < is the closer. The closing tags are characterized by the '/'. \n\nNot all tags require a closing tag, though. The most common tag that doesn't use a closer is the `<img>`  tag. \n\n\n <pre class='language-html'><code>\nHTML\n</code>
